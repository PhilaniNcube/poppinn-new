        Popp Inn Property is a dynamic upmarket property management company that is
        passionate about people and the leisure industry.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base mt-4 text-center">
        We specialise in two areas, helping investors earn a return on their
        properties by managing the property and advertising it to seek clients
        for short-term to long-term leisure or business stays. We utilise very
        effective platforms like AirBnB, Bookings.com and various other social
        media apps to advertise our listings.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base mt-4 text-center">
        Our second area of focus is our customers. We ensure that whenever our
        customers book a stay at any of our properties they leave having
        experienced world-class hospitality and exceptional service. We love to
        add a personal touch so that the customer feels that all of their needs
        are met.
